* goal 
  * experienced ML practitioners' tips & tricks 
  * common patterns | machine learning engineers' daly basis
    * == pragmatic practitioner
* NOT goal == out of this book
  * ML algorithms
    * random forests vs neural networks
  * Building blocks
    * NOT cover DIFFERENT types of gradient descent optimizers or activation functions
  * Model layers
    * convolutional neural networks OR recurrent neural networks
    * doubly disqualifiedâ€”first
* requirements
  * knowledge of machine learning & data processing 
* audience
  * data scientist, data engineer, or ML engineer
    * == 2" machine learning book 
* NOT audience
  * ML scientists OR industry research labs
    * == NOT machine learning model architecture (_Example:_ bidirectional encoders, attention mechanism, or short-circuit layers)
* assumptions
  * you use a pre-built model architecture (_Example:_ ResNet-50 or GRUCell)
    * == NOT write your OWN image classification NOR recurrent neural network
    * if you are doing image classification -> recommended to use an off-the-shelf model (_Example:_ ResNet or whatever the latest hotness)
