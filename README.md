## Goal
* About ML's typical problems
  * BEST practices == design patterns
    * ABOUT
      * data & problem representation,
      * operationalization,
      * repeatability, 
      * reproducibility, 
      * flexibility,
      * explainability, 
      * fairness
    * / 
      * ðŸ’¡(problem's description + potential solutions + recommendations) / EACH pattern ðŸ’¡
  * |
    * training ML models
    * evaluating ML models
    * deploying ML models
